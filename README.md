# CodeClause_Fee_Report

The Fee Report Project is a comprehensive software application developed to facilitate fee collection and reporting processes in educational institutions. This project offers a range of features aimed at simplifying fee management and reporting. Key functionalities of the Fee Report Project include:

User Registration and Authentication: The project starts with user registration and authentication to ensure secure access to the financial data, allowing only authorized personnel to use the system.

Student Management: Users can manage student records, including personal information, enrollment details, and fee-related data.

Fee Structure Configuration: Administrators can define and configure the fee structure, specifying various fee categories, amounts, and payment due dates for each semester or academic year.

Semester Selection: Users can select a specific semester for fee processing and report generation, making it easier to focus on current financial records.

Fee Payment: Students and their guardians can make fee payments through multiple payment methods, such as cash, checks, online transfers, or credit cards. The system records these transactions and updates student accounts accordingly.

Receipt Generation: After successful fee payment, the system automatically generates fee receipts for students. These receipts contain essential details like the student's name, payment date, fee breakdown, and a unique transaction ID.
